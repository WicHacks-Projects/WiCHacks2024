# WiCHacks2024

Surveys show that 56% of women have experienced sexual harassment at the gym, and thus 2 in 5 actively avoid the public gym because of this. With metrics this high, it's clear that women and other gender minorities may be afraid to access fitness resources that can be crucial. For strength training this is especially important; something seemingly as simple as lifting form can cause long-term harm and reduce the benefits of exercising in the first place.

This is where Empower Her training comes in. With the power of Computer Vision, strength train safely and without fear, and track your progress as you learn to lift with proper form.
